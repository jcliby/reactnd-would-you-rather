# Would You Rather Project

Would You Rather is web app that allows a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In the app, users are able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

This project was built using React and Redux.

## Requirements

### LogIn and Navigation Functionality

Users must "log in" by impersonating/selecting an existing user.

Users are able to navigate the app using the navigation bar. Users are also able to navigate the app using the address bar—— however the user will be asked to log in again before the requested page is shown.
